    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the process of classifying transactions from a Monzo Bank statement using rule-based classification. Monzo is a popular digital bank, and its statements often contain detailed transaction data, which can be categorized for better financial management and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this notebook is to demonstrate how to classify bank transactions into predefined categories such as \"Groceries,\" \"Travel,\" \"Eating Out,\" and others. This classification will help in understanding spending patterns, budgeting, and financial planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps in this Notebook:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: Importing the Monzo Bank statement data.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Rule-Based Categorization**: Applying predefined rules to classify transactions into different categories.\n",
    "4. **Analysis and Visualization**: Summarizing and visualizing the categorized data to gain insights into spending behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a clear understanding of how rule-based classification can be applied to bank transaction data to facilitate better financial insights and management. Let's get started!\n",
